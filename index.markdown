### Research topics 
- [Nonlinear filtering and optimal control](./research/#FPF)
- Machine learning ([computational optimal transport](./research/#OT), [sampling](./research/#SM))
- [Stochastic thermodynamics](./research/#Thermo)
<!--My research interest lies at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. In particular, I have been working on problems that can be modelled as a control or optimization problem on the space of probability distributions, such as [Optimal filtering and control](./research/#FPF), [sampling](./research/#SM), [optimal mass transportation](./research/#OT), and [stochastic thermodynamics](./research/#Thermo). The motivation is to design meaningful approximations that can be computed through efficient and scalable numerical algorithms. -->
