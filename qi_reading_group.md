title: QI Reading Group
permalink: /qi_reading_group/
---

The quantum information reading group is intended to be an informal meeting of researchers at all levels in UW to come together to study theoretical research papers in quantum information sciences, interpreted broadly. The papers will typically be on quantum information (QI) theory, QI perspective on many-body physics, quantum computing and occasionally quantum optics/implementations.

### Logistics.
In Winter 2023, this reading group will take place in ECE M406 from 15:30 - 17:00 weekly on wednesdays.

### Guidelines for presenters/volunteers.
1. Try NOT to make slides - an informal white-board presentation is prefered.
2. It would be prefered to not review a paper in isolation, but review a "connected body of work". We can allow a presentation to spill over multiple sessions to make it more "tutorial like" if needed.
3. Both recent papers/preprints or older well established relevant papers can be reviewed.
4. The set of papers is upto the presenter as long as it is within the scope of the reading group.
